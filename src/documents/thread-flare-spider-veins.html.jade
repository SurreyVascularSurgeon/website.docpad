            p(itemprop="signOrSymptom" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/MedicalSymptom")
              | Flare veins (also known as thread or broken veins) are tiny surface veins that can appear blue, red
              | or pale green. They can be on any part of the body but are most commonly treated on the legs and face.
              | They 
              span(itemprop="name") ache 
              | and sometimes 
              span(itemprop="name") itch.

            p We offer treatment with Micro Sclerotherapy.

            h3 What are Varicose Veins
            p
              | Varicose veins are bigger, blue veins that often bulge but can be flat. They also occur on the legs
              | and are often caused by a defect in the veins. If the varicose veins are minor they can be treated with
              | injection sclerotherapy too. This will be discussed during your consultation.

              span(itemprop="name") Vein Sclerotherapy
            p
              | Sclerotherapy involves injecting a small volume of a irritant liquid into affected veins. The liquid acts
              | upon the lining of the vein to cause it to seal shut, eliminating the visibility of the  vein. Sclerotherapy
              | can be quickly performed at our clinic and no anaesthesia is required.

            h3 What to Expect
            p
              | When injected, the vein disappears, but then almost immediately becomes red and inflamed. The leg can
              | ache after treatment and this is a consequence of the irritant liquid working. The inflammation
              | settles over a period of days and the vein then becomes scarred and shrinks over weeks.
              | It then takes a number of weeks for the result to be evident, often 6-8 weeks. However, a final result may take many months.

              +faq_item('_how_does_sclerotherapy_work', 'How does sclerotherapy work ?')
                p
                  | Using a very fine needle, I can inject the sclerosant into the veins you wish treated.
                  | The sclerosant irritates the vein and causes it to scar and then shrink away. The vein then
                  | fades over time.

              +faq_item('_treatment_areas', 'Which areas can be treated ?')
                p
                  | Any area can be treated, but most commonly the legs and face are affected and therefore
                  | treated. If you need treatment to your face we recommend that a local anaesthetic cream
                  | is applied prior to sclerotherapy as the face is a sensitive area.

              +faq_item('_need_to_stay', 'Do I need to stay after treatment ?')
                p
                  | No. Straight after the treatment you can walk out and you will be able to drive yourself
                  | home if required. You leg may ache a little due to the irritation. You can take some paracetamol
                  | to help, but the majority of patients do not need this either.

              +faq_item('_results', 'How long does it take to see a result ?')
                p
                  | Initially, the treated veins will look worse before they look better as the injection causes
                  | an irritation to do it's job. The process of scarring and shrinking away takes between 4-6 weeks
                  | but can take up to 6 months.

              +faq_item('_clothing', 'Should I wear anything special ?')
                p
                  | It is  better if you don't wear light or white clothing on your legs as sometimes the injection site
                  | may bleed a little. Looser clothes are better as you may find that more comfortable afterwards.

              +faq_item('_preparation', 'Do I need to prepare prior to treatment ?')
                p
                  | There is nothing special you need to do. The sclerosant works by inflaming the vein so I recommend
                  | avoiding anti-inflammatory medicines (such as aspirin, ibuprofen) 48 hours before and after treatment.

              +faq_item('_things_to_avoid', 'Should I avoid anything after treatment ?')
                p
                  | You will be able to walk out after the treatment and resume normal activities straight away. I
                  | recommend not soaking in a hot bath, going to a Spa or direct sun exposure for 1 week after the
                  | treatment as this can dilate your veins and may cause the treatment not to work. You can resume
                  | exercise 24 hours afterwards and it is safe to fly.

              +faq_item('_is_sclerotherapy_new', 'Is sclerotherapy a new treatment ?')
                p
                  | Sclerotherapy for veins is not a new treatment. It has been used since the 1930s for treatment and a
                  | number of research papers have shown that it works.

              +faq_item('_is_sclerotherapy_effctive', 'Is sclerotherapy effective ?')
                p
                  | Studies have shown that around 70% of veins treated this way show a marked improvement. It is common
                  | to require more than one session for treatment. A maximum dose restricts the total area that can be
                  | treated in one sitting. The area that can be treated will be discussed with you prior to any treatment
                  | commencing.

              +faq_item('_sclerotherapy_risks', 'Are there any risks from sclerotherapy ?')
                P
                  | After treatment your legs may ache or feel itchy. The site of injection can become red and a
                  | little swollen. This should settle within days.
                p
                  | Some patients experience bruising around the injection site or may get small skin sores or ulcers. This
                  | is more common if the ankle area is treated.

                p
                  | The skin area over the injection site can become darken or stained with a brownish discolouration. If
                  | this occurs it usually fades, but can take up to a year.

                p
                  | Any harmful risks of sclerotherapy are rare. Some people will be allergic to the solution and may
                  | get an allergic reactions. Under very rare circumstances DVT and visual disturbances have been reported.

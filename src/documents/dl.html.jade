            h3 What are flare veins
            p
              | Flare veins (also known as thread or broken veins) are tiny surface veins that can appear blue, red
              | or pale green. They can be on any part of the body but are most commonly treated on the legs and face.

            p We offer treatment with Micro Sclerotherapy.
            
            h3 What are Varicose Veins
            p
              | Varicose veins are bigger, blue veins that often bulge but can be flat. They also occur on the legs
              | and are often caused by a defect in the veins. If the varicose veins are minor they can be treated with
              | injection sclerotherapy too. This will be discussed during your consultation.


            h3 Vein Sclerotherapy
            p
              | Sclerotherapy involves injecting a small volume of a irritant liquid into affected veins. The liquid acts
              | upon the lining of the vein to cause it to seal shut, eliminating the visibility of the  vein. Sclerotherapy
              | can be quickly performed at our clinic and no anaesthesia is required.

            h3 What to expect
            p
              | When injected, the vein disappears, but then almost immediately becomes red and inflamed. The leg can
              | ache after treatment and this is a consequence of the irritant liquid working. The inflammation settles
              | over a period of weeks and should settle completely by six weeks.

            p
              | Other risks include: allergic reactions, bruising, small skin sores or ulcers, darkening of the skin.

            p
              | There are limits to the area that can be treated in each sitting and sometimes an area will need to be treated more than once.

            h3 Cost and Booking

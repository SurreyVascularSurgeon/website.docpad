            p
              | An aneursym is a swelling in an artery (blood vessel). An Abdominal Aortic Aneursym
              | (or AAA) occurs in the main blood vessel that comes out of the heart and decsends
              | down through the chest and into the abdomen supplying the guts, kidneys and other
              | organs. The aorta then divides to supply blood to the buttocks and legs.

            p
              | A normal abdominal aorta is 2cm in diameter and anything over 3cm is considered an aneursym. As
              | an aneursym grows in size there is a risk that it can burst (rupture). If this happens
              | there is significant bleeding and the result is often fatal. However that risk
              | is small when the aneursym is small. Below 4cm the annual rupture risk is 0.5%

            h2 Symptoms

            p
              | Most aneursyms do not cause any symptoms and so patients generally do not know they
              | have an aneursym. Some patients may feel a pulsitile swelling in their abdomen (tummy)
              | and rarely the aneursym can causes clots to fly of down to the legs and feet.

            p
              | If an aneursym ruptures (bursts) then the patient will get a sudden pain, usually in
              | the back and possibily in the abdomen. The pain may spread down into the groin area.
              | Because of the bleeding a patient may collapse and become pale.

            p
              | A ruptured aneursym is an emergency that a 999 ambulance should be called for.

            h2 Diagnosis

            p
              | In most cases an abdominal arotic aneursym can be diagnosed and screened for with
              | a simple ultrasound test. The size of the aneursym can be determined and if regular
              | size measurements are required then the aneursym can be followed using ultrasound
              | too.

            h2 Treatments

            p
              | At present treatment consists of three options.
              ol
                li Regular ultrasound follow up measurements
                li Open surgical repair
                li Endovascular (minimally invasive) repair, known as EVAR or EVAS

              | In all cases it is important address other factors that include:

              ul
                li Stopping smoking
                li Lowering cholesterol and starting on a statin tablet
                li Control of blood pressure

            p
              | The operation to repair and aneursym does have some risks. An abdominal
              | aortic aneursym that measures less than 5.5cm has a very low risk of rupture
              | and the risks of repair are greater. That is why it is usual for your surgeon
              | to only offer a repair if your aneursym measures 5.5cm or greater or if your
              | anaeursym starts to grow rapidly.

            h3 Open Surgical Repair

            p
              | This is the traditional method of repairing an abdominal aortic aneursym.
              | Invariably a general anaesthetic is reqiured and the operation involved the
              | abdomen being opened for direct access to the aneursym. The weakened area is then
              | identified an clamps placed above and below that area to stop blood flow. The
              | aneursym is then opened and a synthetic graft is sewn in place to replace the
              | weak section. This can either be a straight tube of one that splits like an
              | upside down Y to the arteries that supply each leg.

            p
              | This surgery takes about 3-6 hours and a patient can expect to stay in hospital for
              | between 3 and 8 days.

            img.border-img.img-responsive(src="/img/endovascular_aneurysm_repair.jpg" align="right" alt="How to do endovascular aneurysm repair")

            p
              | Endovascular aneursym repair is a newer technique that works by lining the aneursym
              | from the inside. However, it now has been established practise for around 10 years.
            p
              | Access to the aneursym is obtained by small cuts in the groins exposing the femoral
              | vessels. Guide wires are placed using xray guidance to visualise the inside
              | of the body. The stent graft is then delivered along the wires into the correct
              | position and released into place.

            p 
              | The most common stent graft (EVAR) procedure places the graft below the kidney
              | arteries.

            p
              | Not all aneursyms can treated with a standard stent graft that sits below the kidney
              | arteries. And sometimes the blood vessels below the aneursym prevent access and so a
              | stent graft can not be placed.

            p
              | If there isn't space below the kidney arteries to place a stent graft then a custom
              | made device can be manufactured with holes for the kidney and gut arteries cut out
              | to allow a graft to placed accross them and little stents bridge between the main
              | stent graft and the branch arteries. This is called a fenestrated or branched custom
              | stent graft.

            //- p
            //-   | As the operations to repair a AAA carries a risk of complications and
            //-   | a small risk of death we generally recomend that aneursyms are only treated
            //-   | once they are 5.5cm or larger. Below this size your aneursym will be reviewed
            //-   | regularily with an ultrasound scan.

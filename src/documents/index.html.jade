          p
            | I qualified from Guys and St Thomas' Hospital in 1997 and then worked in a number
            | of units across the south of England, completing my higher surgical training in the
            | South West Thames region. I undertook my endovascular fellowship back at St Thomas'
            | Hospital and then the Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton.

          p
            | I am a substantive NHS consultant surgeon at #[a(href="https://www.fhft.nhs.uk/") Frimley Park NHS Hospital] with a 
            | specialist interest in endovascular techniques
            | and interventional radiology. I jointly lead for vascular simulator training and
            | teach on a number of courses about vascular and general surgery (including the
            | Registrar Ready Course, St Thomasâ€™ MRCS course and London post-graduate EVAR course).
            | I am the the vascular lead for the diabetic foot service
            | at #[a(href="http://royal-surrey.net/") Royal Surrey, Guildford Hospital] and 
            | lead on a new stent graft system called Nellix, used in the treatment of infra-renal and more complex aneurysms.

          p
            | I maintain an active research interest and I am the principal investigator at Frimley Park for the 3D image registration
            | mapping project for aortic aneurysm repair. I have published in a number of peer reviewed journals on general surgical
            | and vascular topics and presented at a number of National and International meetings.

          p
            | I am a director of a medical software company (
            a(href="http://www.clinsoftsolutions.com") Clinical Software Solutions
            | ) specialising in developing healthcare
            | software and mobile applications.

  //-             | commonest ones we treat are in the abdomen, called abdominal
  //-             | aortic aneursyms (AAA).
  //-           p
  //-             | Traditional treatment involved a surgical
  //-             | cut in the tummy and repair by sewing in a graft.
  //-             | A minimally invasive treatment called EVAR or EVAS can
  //-             | now be carried out through small incisions in the groins

  //-             | in the neck can become &quot;furred up&quot;. Patients may

  //-             | a mini stroke as part of the tests you have, someone will look
  //-             | at your carotid artery with a ultrasound. If significant disease
  //-             | is found it might be appropriate to have the artery cleared
  //-             | out with an operation
